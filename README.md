# Analog Circuit Design at 45nm CMOS

This repository documents the design, simulation, and layout (in-progress) of key analog building blocks using the 45nm GPDK in Cadence. The project includes a Differential Amplifier, a Ring Oscillator, and a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO).

## 🚀 Overview

### 🔹 Differential Amplifier
- Built with 45nm GPDK in Cadence Virtuoso.
- Performed transient analysis to validate differential gain and common-mode rejection.

### 🔹 Ring Oscillator
- Developed a 3-stage CMOS inverter-based ring oscillator.
- Oscillation frequency and layout design are currently under progress.

### 🔹 Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)
- Design phase underway.
- Focused on tuning range, frequency stability, and PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature) robustness.
